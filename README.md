- 👋 Hi, I’m Kim Bradshaw.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding! I've worked with many programming languages over the years of my career. Mostly recently I've been working in backend services with Node.js and Express and .Net Core and C# deployed to Google Cloud using Docker and Kubernetes. For work-related fun, I've explored OpenAPI and syncing OpenAPI docs to Postman API/Collections via the Postman API. (Whew! Can you say API one more time!) For non-work fun, I've participated in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2020 and 2021 using Javascript. (Although, I have so much fun with AoC that I think I'm going to solve it each month with a different language. Hasn't happened so far. Life.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Go. My list of things I want to learn goes on and on beyond time available.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... uhhhh, would totally like to find something to contribute to in the open source world but haven't found my jam. Peanut, peanut butter! Jelly!
